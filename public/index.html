    <h1>The Italian Resturant</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning.</p>
    <p> It is the middle of July, shining blue skies with clouds painted across the horizon. 
      The sun is starting to decline, casting a golden hue through the trees.

  and you are walking to the cities best Italian resturant, with thousands of five

you pass by a clothing store that catches your eye. It is 6:45, and 
the resturant is still a few blocks away.
